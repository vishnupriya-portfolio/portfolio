        <p>If you look back at the life of the people who have lived it well, one thing you will find for all them is that they have always believed that learning is a life long skill and from time and time you need to question your learning and improvise on it.</p>

        <p>These bits of wisdom that I am sharing with all you are highlights that I would like to put in place in my own life and are from a Farnam Street blog that talks about the life of Charlie Munger( a life well lived indeed!)</p>
        <h4>Inversion: When solving a problem, think backwards</h4>

        <p>For example: Let’s talk about healthy eating habits, most of us give in to our cravings of junk food now and then and it is normal to binge eat once in a while but how do you develop healthy eating habits
          If I apply inversion to this, the first question that comes to my mind is When do I binge-eat?
          out with friends
          feeling low and overthinking
          sitting idle
          So for me, the best way to switch to healthy eating habits is to avoid sitting idle and letting my emotions take the better side of me.
          Once I am busy, my mind gives less attention to food. Food then becomes a necessity for me only when I am hungry and not a pass-time activity.</p>

          <h4>Avoid self-pity and resentment and self-serving bias</h4>

          <p>BIG BIG LIFE LESSON HERE
            For the longest time in my life, I have felt miserable having lost my mother at an early age and being raised by a single parent
            Now when I think about it, self -pity doesn’t get you anywhere in life. All that time when I was looking at other kids with happy families, where did it get me?
            It ended up doing me more harm and impacting other areas of my life than good ever.
            No matter how bad the situation, avoid self-pity.
            An important reminder: You are not the one with all the miseries of the world</p>

        <h4>Keep doing it till it is not done</h4>
        <p>I think about writing this blog for the last 1 week and every day something more urgent comes up and this gets delayed.
          Sometimes ( or most of the times ) you need to stretch yourself and work on things until they are done.
          Be a doer and not a talker.</p>
        <h4>Mental model and frameworks</h4>
        <p>There are a lot of articles around mental models and frameworks and, I am sure they work well for most of us. But what gets you ahead in life is not just practising them but also question them when needed and see how you can make them work in your favour in a better way.</p>
        <h4>Do not stick to an ideology very rigidly</h4>
        <p>We live in an information overload era, so the best way to grow your mental framework is to not stick to an ideology very rigidly.
        People who don’t agree with you aren’t necessarily always wrong but just have a different path to follow.</p>
        <h4>Wisdom is a lifelong skill</h4>
        <p>You owe it to yourself to learn something new every day. Like civilizations, progress when they reinvent ways of doing things, likewise you have to keep learning and relearning to move ahead in life.</p>
        <h4>Work with people you respect and admire :)</h4>
