        <p>How can you make your company stand out in this era of clickbait ads and offers floating across all digital

          Let us start with the 4 rules that all online businesses need to keep in mind before they start their journey

        <blockquote>Who are your dream customers?</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Where do you find the congregation of these customers?</blockquote>
        <blockquote>What exactly will you offer them?</blockquote>
        <blockquote>What value would you provide to them ultimately?</blockquote>

        <p>Let us take an example of an online pet store selling pet food and accessories

          Dream customers would-be pet owners, foster pet parents, pet care facilities and boarding houses

          These customers can be found on social media channels like Instagram, youtube, Facebook where people love
          sharing their pets with friends and families

          They can also be found participating in various offline pet activities and competitions

          Once you have identified who your dream customers are, the next step is to identify what value or offer would
          you provide them? This is what makes all the difference

          Most businesses think of selling at a lower price so that they can attract more customers. It is no advantage
          to fall in the second-lowest price category for any product

          The key is to not cut down on your cost but offer more value

          What do I mean by value here? Lets take an example

          As an online pet store, the immediate offering that comes to your target customer’s mind is

          Pet food and accessories

          How can you make this offer more compelling?</p>
        <h4>What else can you offer?</h4>
        <p>Special offers on Birthday treats and goodies for the registered pet parents

          A one-time discount code for a pet salon

          Freebies every quarter on becoming a registered member by paying a certain annual fee

          Free mention of the pet on social media sites and blogs by making them the brand ambassadors

          Avail free shipping ( in certain parts of the country)

          5% off on all pet accessories across the year</p>

          <h4>An online pet store that is just known for selling pet food and accessories has increased its value 10x more
          by adding more value to his offer</h4>

          <p>As a business owner or an entrepreneur, a large part of your life will go away in crafting compelling offers
          for your customers. The best way to do this is to list down all the possible options and weigh the pros and
          cons of each offer and then select the most compelling ones.

          The last part is the most difficult one here when it comes to internet businesses

          What value would you provide to them ultimately?

          Like in this case of the online pet store, the ultimate value would be to understand the problem pet parents
          face currently when dealing with offline stores and provide them with an overall better experience online.

          Before you start your online marketing journey, I think it is important to answer these 4 questions. These 4
          questions will help you craft not only a clear strategy but also help you know if you are heading in the right
          direction and measure the outcomes accordingly.</p>
